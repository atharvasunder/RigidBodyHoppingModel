# RigidBodyHoppingModel
Two Segment Hopping Model Actuated by a Hill-Type Muscle (with each segment having mass)

Python implementation of the 2003 paper "Positive force feedback in bouncing gaits?" with each segment having mass. FIFO Buffers are used to simulate delays in feedback. Here is a video of the simulation
